ABSTRACT

Works of science fiction have been pointed as an important resource in the teaching of science. However, more than a possible didactic resource to facilitate the learning of science, science fiction constitutes in itself a modality of discourse about science, insofar as it expresses through cinema and literature, interests and concerns about current scientific issues that impact directly on the socio-cultural sphere. It is, nevertheless, common to regard the possible didactic quality of fictional works only in terms of the supposed scientific correction of the concepts they present, an attitude that ignores the conditions of production of the fictional discourse. In the present work a methodology is proposed to analyze the content of works of science fiction in their relation to scientific knowledge, trying to reveal through elements of literary analysis and semiotics the process of construction of what we called counterfactual elements.
