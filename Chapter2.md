 The present analysis views the work of fiction not just as a simple didactic element, but as a discourse governed by fictional mechanisms, and that makes use of these mechanisms to convey positions, ideas and debates around current scientific themes.
 
 As a result, a categorization of these elements was developed based on the Greimasian semiotics, employing a set of distinctive features assumed as lexemes in the definition of the categories.
 
 By representing distinct narrative mechanisms, each one of these categories has the potential to be explored differently in didactic terms.
